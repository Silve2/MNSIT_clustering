# MNSIT_clustering
This project explores unsupervised learning techniques for clustering handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Instead of relying on labeled data, I used clustering algorithms combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze how well different methods can group digits based on their intrinsic patterns.
